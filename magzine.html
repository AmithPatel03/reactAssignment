                <p>Seba was a collector of zoological and other natural subjects and the editor of an illustrated work
                    of reference about his collection.</p>
                <p>He accumulated one of the largest cabinets of curiosities in the Netherlands during his time. He sold
                    one of his cabinets in 1717 to Peter the Great of Russia. His later collections were auctioned after
                    his death.</p>
                <p>His early work on taxonomy and natural history influenced Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist
                    Carl Linnaeus.</p>

        <div class="o-grid__area-04 o-content">
            <p>Born in Etzel, Seba moved to Amsterdam as an apprentice and, around 1700, opened a pharmacy near the
                harbor. Seba asked sailors and ship surgeons to bring exotic plants and animal products he could use for
                preparing drugs. Seba also started to collect snakes, birds, insects, shells, and lizards in his house.
            </p>
            <p>In October 1728, Seba became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1734, he published a Thesaurus of animal
                specimens with beautiful engravings. The full name of the Thesaurus is, with a dual Latin–Dutch title,
                <em>Locupletissimi rerum naturalium thesauri accurata descriptio</em> (Accurate description of the very
                rich thesaurus of the principal and rarest natural objects).</p>
            <p>Today, the original 446-plate volume is on permanent exhibit at the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague,
                Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Seba's inclusion of fantastic beasts such as the hydra influenced Linnaeus to include the "Paradoxa,"
                species which may exist but which have not been found, in his <em>Systema Naturae</em>.</p>
            <p>Seba is commemorated in the scientific names of two species and one subspecies of snakes: <em>Ninia
                    sebae</em>, <em>Python sebae</em>, and <em>Oxyrhopus petola sebae</em>.</p>
